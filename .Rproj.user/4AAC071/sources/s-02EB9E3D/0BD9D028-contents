For new R useRs: open R studio and type the following code into the console, OR you can go over the "Packages" tab in the bottom right hand corner of R studio, click "install", and type in the names of the packages that you would like to install. Once you have installed a package on your computer, there is no need to install again. Instead, each time you need to use the package you use the *library()* code (as shown below).

install.packages("igraph")

install.packages("Hmisc")

library(Hmisc) 

install.packages("Matrix")
